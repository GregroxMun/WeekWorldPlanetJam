# WeekWorldPlanetJam
*A collaboration between ten contributors to create a Kerbal Space Program planet mod within the span of one week.*

On 2022 August 14, at the behest of @Techo, ten planet builders on the Gregrox Mods discord server came together to build a solar system together within one week, in an event called the Week World Planet Jam. We present the results of this collaboration here. The Sauwel system contains 9 planetary systems comprising 30 celestial bodies. Aside from a few initial conditions, each contributor created their planet blind, with no spoilers or hints about the other contributors' work. The system is therefore an interesting mix of different styles of planet design, resulting in a system where every planet is something of a unique oddball.

Mod dependencies:
* Kopernicus (and its dependencies) https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases
* KopernicusExpansions-Continueder https://github.com/VabienArt/KopernicusExpansion-Continueder/releases/
    * Specifically KEX-Common, KEX-RegionalPQS and KEX-VertexHeightMap16

System layout:

The Sauwel planetary system contains a total of 30 objects, including one star and three gas giants, split up into nine orbits. Result is a system of similar complexity to the real-world Solar System, but with a unique layout and some strange and interesting planets.

Screenshot of the layout of the inner system:
![A screenshot of Kerbal Space Program with Week World Planet Jam installed. A yellow star is at the center, with three concentric circular orbits indicated close in, a slightly elliptical orbit slightly farther out, and two very elliptical orbits. The two very elliptical orbits are pointing away from each other, with their apoapsis on the opposite side of the star.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9667986/186221042-e584b3a3-eec1-4104-959c-f8ef27497fec.png)

Screenshot of the layout of the outer system:
![A zoomed out version of the above. about twice as far away from the star as the apoapsis of the elliptical orbit from the previous image, is a circular orbit, and beyond that are two very elliptical orbits.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9667986/186221979-6f8245b2-1a45-40e3-b5d4-268dfdbf18c4.png)
