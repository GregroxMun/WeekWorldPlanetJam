	Homeworld = AsitePar
	
	//Options are AsitePar and Kerbin.
	//Default is AsitePar.
	//Caen and Elaan options are planned but not currently supported.
	//When set to Kerbin, an unmodified stock Kerbin will be placed into a 0.292 au orbit around Sauwel.
	//Kerbin is essentially a debug option--it is not intended to be played from. Its orbit will also be super close to Windswept.
	
	ScaledspaceClouds = True
	
	//Options are True or False. (Case sensitive.)
	//True: Use a global dust storm map on Windswept
	//False: Use Windswept's unfinished pqs colormap as a scaledspace map.
	
	//Planned additional settings:
	//Kronometer compatibility
	//Sun color correction mode (pale yellow default vs "orange" dwarf)
	//Sun intensity curve setting (continuous light versus dimmer light with distance)
