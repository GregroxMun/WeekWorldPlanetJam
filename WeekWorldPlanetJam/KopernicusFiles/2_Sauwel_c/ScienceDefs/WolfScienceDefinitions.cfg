	RESULTS
	{
		Exular = To no one’s surprise, this small moon has no thermal emissions of its own, the only variance in temperature comes from how much light is reflected or blocked by Exular’s surface.
		Yroptos = The thermal environment of this double asteroid is entirely defined by Sauwel, and these little worlds don’t do anything to resist that fact.
		Ribo = If you kept the experiment running long enough, and with equipment sensitive enough, you could probably measure the strength of the energy being reflected by Reticulum's rings from here, otherwise Ribo's temperature is only distinct from the rest of space in this part of the Sauwel System when its blocking out the star's light.

		GolgiInSpace = There's no notable change in the temperature here, it's all vacuum.
		LysoInSpace = There is a slight uptick in temperature readings, it's barely perceptible. There seems to be a high-energy particle cloud of some sort around Lyso.
		CytoselInSpace = This old world shows no signs of thermal emissions nor a medium through which they can be seen, its patchwork of different colorations does however mean the amount of reflected energy is fairly variable.

		ReticulumInSpace = This region of the solar system seems a bit hot for liquid water bodies, and yet . . .
		ReticulumFlyingHigh = The temperature is beginning to pick up as Reticulum's massive atmosphere puts on the pressure, at 32 kilometers there's a spike before readings begin to fall again. Reticulum has a thermosphere!
		ReticulumFlyingLow = At this altitude, below 14.5 kilometers, the temperatures are beginning to rise again, and quickly.
		ReticulumLanded = It would seem that Reticulum's surface is indeed cool enough to host water oceans. Sitting at 80 celsius however, it is far too warm to host Kerbals.
		ReticulumLandedPoles = These were originally suspected to be made of water ice, however it is clearly far too warm for that to be the case.
		ReticulumSplashed = Reticulum's seas are over twice the heat of a standard hot tub, and a Kerbal would instantly receive scalding third degree burns if they attempted to swim in them. Calling Reticulum "habitable" is certainly a bit of a stretch.
		ReticulumSplashedCenterOceans = These oceans are notably hotter than they should be otherwise, the surface of the water is steaming. There must be a heatsource deep below the water here.

		AsiteParInSpaceHigh = This region of the solar system is effectively just as hot as Reticulum's, that is to say, not very pleasant, but not unlivable.
		AsiteParInSpaceLow = Asite Par hosts a fair amount of reflective cloud cover, the effect of the clouds bouncing energy onto the craft is noticeable.
		AsiteParFlyingHigh = You've past the peak temperature of Asite Par's thermosphere.
		AsiteParFlyingLow = Asite Par is not as hot as it could've been all things considered, but it's not comfortable.
		AsiteParLanded = Asite Par's slow rotation is its only defense against the heat of Sauwel, and it doesn't accomplish much. Kerbals need to walk around with extensive cooling systems here.
		AsiteParSplashed = To say the water is steamy would be an understatement, swimming in it without protection would result in heavy burns very quickly.

		Exular = There is no detectable devation from the vacuum of space around Exular.
		Yroptos = The Yroptos Double System has no notable exosphere, the only particles living in space around it are occasional ions stripped from the surface of Yroptos by the lashing of Sauwel's winds.
		Ribo = Ribo has no notable exosphere. You wonder if moonlets in the rings might experience some amount of drag.

		Golgi = Golgi is a vacuum, both in orbit and on the ground.
		LysoInSpace = Nothing from out here.
		LysoInSpaceLow = Lyso has a thin exosphere, though its specific nature is unclear, one may find over very long timescales objects may fall from orbit here. However the uneven gravity of its lumpy surface would likely accomplish that much faster.
		LysoLanded = The exosphere of Lyso is detectable, but only barely.
		CytoselInSpace = Any atmosphere that may exist here is not able to be detected from up here.
		CytoselLanded = The exosphere makes itself known, quietly. It's very inconsequential to the operation of spacecraft.

		ReticulumInSpaceHigh = Reticulum's atmosphere certainly exists, but does not extend this far.
		ReticulumInSpaceLow = Reticulum's exosphere extends to this distance, and the rings will certainly be lost to drag on astronomically short timescales.
		Reticulum = Reticulum's surface pressure would be survivable to a Kerbal without a spacesuit, if only barely. Eventually that will change for the worse, much worse.
		ReticulumFlyingHigh = Reticulum's atmosphere strikes suddenly and without warning, though there's other places in the Sauwel System that have it much worse.
		ReticulumFlyingLow = The pressure continues to rise, there is concern regarding what conditions await on the surface.
		ReticulumLandedPeaks = With altitude there is a notable drop in pressure, three quarters of a standard Kerbin atmosphere, but it's still far higher than Kerbals are used to.
		ReticulumSplashedCenterOceans = There's a detectable vapor pressure here as steam rises around the craft.
		
		AsiteParFlyingHigh = Asite Par's atmosphere is quite extensive, you wonder if rockets are necessary to get this far up, or if an ascent could be made on alternative means.
		AsiteParFlyingLow = The atmosphere pressure is still fairly impressive up here.
		AsitePar = For its size and location, Asite Par has managed to snag quite the envelope, it's within the range friendly to Kerbals. Of course, Asite Par has other ways of killing you.

	RESULTS
	{
		Exular = Exular's gravity makes Yroptos' look strong. Variations in Exular's gravity well point towards several hollow cavities within.
		Yroptos = Yroptos' gravity may be minimal, but it's just enough to keep Exular happily in orbit. Only just. There are some indications that Yroptos is partially differentiated, and features that almost resemble magma chambers lie just below the curst.
		Ribo = Within this keyhole of gravity, Ribo is stable trailing an average of 60 degrees behind Golgi in its orbit. You can't help but wonder if Golgi was inspired by its parent planet.
		RiboLanded = Ribo seems to be a solid unit all the way through.

		GolgiInSpaceHigh = Golgi has fairly strong gravity, enough to have significant influence on the structure of the inner Reticulum System. However, in the future the scales may tip in Reticulum's favor.
		GolgiInSpaceLow = Golgi's crust seems to be fairly heterogenous, with many distinct units of material of various scales scattered from the surface to the upper extent of a continuous mantle.
		GolgiInSpaceLowNorthRegion = This wide area, which occupies most of Golgi's northern hemisphere shows signs of an uplift in the underlying mantle, and the crust here is consistent and homogenous in structure, a material discontinuity with its surroundings.
		GolgiInSpaceLowHighland = These strange lumps on Golgi's surface do not have nearly the mass suggested by their size. Within these mounds, one might find they are significantly empty space.
		GolgiLandedHighland = The domeworks are just that, hollow domes, perhaps created by volcanic processes not seen elsewhere. One may want to watch their step, they're unlikely to be entirely stable.
		GolgiLandedCraters = Below the ground there seem to be several underlying units that have been compressed and fused by the energy of the impact that made this basin. These units likely existed as structures of notable vertical relief and high porosity prior to this impact.
		GolgiLanded = Thanks to the instrument's sensitivity, the gravity of Reticulum is notably measurable from here. In the future Golgi will likely crumble as it falls inwards, forming a new, far denser Reticuloid Ring System.

		LysoInSpace = This Reticuloid Moon is expected to slowly spiral out from Reticulum. However, these readings on the local gravity field make it seem probable that as Golgi spirals in, it may drag Lyso along with it, and once Golgi has been disrupted, it may be too late for Lyso.
		LysoInSpaceLow = Lyso is most spherical, but its dramatic relief makes measuring the precise structures within somewhat challenging. Compensating for that variation, Lyso shows indications of a solid core, and a mostly solidified mantle. The asthenosphere does show some indications of plasticity, but if it does exist, it is quite weak.
		LysoLanded = Lyso is a very consistent object internally, and shows no signs of anomalous structures within.

		CytoselInSpace = Cytosel has a very significant gravity well for its size, thanks to its location on the edge of the Reticulum System. In the distant future it may enjoy some time as a planet of its own, orbiting Sauwel independently.
		CytoselInSpaceLow = Cytosel shows little signs of any fluid motion internally, and seems to be comprised of simplistic layers, a metal core, rocky mantle, and thin crust, with the only variation being the thickness of the latter.
		CytoselInSpaceLowLow = Cytosel's crust is thinner in these regions, and shows signs of porosity. Perhaps lava tubes from a once-volcanic past.
		CytoselLanded = Recordings of the local gravity field point to few variations in the underlying crust.
		CytoselLandedLow = Recordings of the local gravity field point to cavernous structures below.

		ReticulumInSpaceHigh = Reticulum makes itself known with its extensive gravity well, and seems to be using the space well.
		ReticulumInSpaceLow = The Reticuloid crust has several distinct layers, which seem to have been deposited layer-by-layer by volcanic activity. But where are the volcanoes?
		ReticulumInSpaceLowLand = The crust seems to be compressed into mountains and canyons, with the layers bunched up into features that run perpendicular to the coasts of the Nucleic Oceans.
		ReticulumInSpaceLowCenterOceans = Below these circular oceans, the crust is extremely thin compared to other regions of the planet, with the mantle intruding significantly.
		ReticulumInSpaceLowSeas = The crust seems to have buckled in response to the pressure expanding out from the vicinity of the Nucleic Oceans, this may put some pressure on the underlying mantle, and perhaps introduces water to Reticulum's asthenosphere.
		ReticulumInSpaceLowPoles = These readings are inconsistent with water ice, however there does seem to be many caves below the cap, and they're full of something.
		ReticulumLanded = The units below the surface tell the tale of a violently geologically active world, where land is crunched, molded, and recycled at the will of dramatic volcanism.
		ReticulumSplashed = The crust below the water seems to have fractured, but remains quite thick.
		ReticulumSplashedCenterOceans = There seem to be several large intrusive zones below the water, these are consistent with... volcanic magma chambers.
		ReticulumLandedPoles = There are caves potentially filled with natural greenhouse gasses below the surface. The geology is quite turbulent on Reticulum, so they're unlikely to stay in the ground much longer. This planet is going to get a whole lot worse.
		ReticulumFlying = Variations in the make up of the surface are recorded as the craft flies overhead.
		
		AsiteParInSpaceHigh = Asite Par has a decently sized hillsphere, it's a shame it hasn't caught any moons.
		AsiteParInSpaceLow = From this altitude various structures can be observed within Asite Par's interior, there is a large discontinuity in the mantle, where a long-lost subducted continent is slowly being reclaimed. The crust also shows a fair amount of variance in its thickness.
		AsiteParFlyingOceans = The oceans are slightly denser than otherwise expected for water, suggesting they are quite briney, anyone with a tongue could've told you that, if they were willing to risk burning it.
		AsiteParFlying = Taking measurements of how the density of the surface below varies from place to place will go a long way in the quest to understand Asite Par's geology.
		AsiteParLanded = There are very few caverns in Asite Par's crust, and this reading doesn't change that.

	RESULTS
	{
		ReticulumFlying = Reticulum's atmosphere seems to be largely nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
		ReticulumFlyingLow = The atmosphere seems to have very trace amounts of noble gasses, and is otherwise largely nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
		ReticulumLanded = Reticulum's atmosphere is  68% Nitrogen, 31% Carbon Dioxide, and a full percent Argon.
		ReticulumSplashed = Reticulum's atmosphere is  68% Nitrogen, 31% Carbon Dioxide, and a full percent Argon.
		ReticulumSplashedCenterOceans = There is a great amount of steam coming off the water here, and it's making it difficult to measure the exact ratios of other atmospheric gasses.

		AsiteParFlying = Over three fourths of Asite Par's atmosphere is made entirely of carbon dioxide. One wonders how much nicer it would be temperature wise if that wasn't the case.
		AsiteParFlyingLow = Three quarters are carbon dioxide, and the rest seems to be made of nitrogen and other trace gasses.
		AsiteParLanded = Asite Par's atmosphere is 77% Carbon Dioxide, 21% Nitrogen, 1% Oxygen and about 1% Argon.
		AsiteParSplashed = Asite Par's atmosphere is 77% Carbon Dioxide, 21% Nitrogen, 1% Oxygen and about 1% Argon.
		AsiteParLandedPlont = At least the moss enjoys the carbon dioxide, and the oxygen it provides in return helps to make Asite Par somewhat livable. One wonders how stable that arrangement might be long term.

	RESULTS
	{
		ExularLanded = There are no signs of any internal activity, not even from gravitational stresses, not that there would be much of that coming from Yroptos.
		YroptosLanded = Yroptos is definitely geologically dead, which is a shame
		RiboLanded = Ribo experiences some weak quakes, with Reticulum, Golgi, and Lyso nearby, that's not surprising.

		GolgiLanded = Quakes are detected as Golgi is strained by Reticulum's gravity.
		GolgiLandedNorthRegion = Seismic activity is detected as the convective cells that make up this region slowly churn. It's unclear if this action represents the last remaining activity of a once hyperactive geologic past, or the beginning of a new era of activity as the tidal stresses from Reticulum increase.
		GolgiLandedHighland = The instrument detects an event of unclear origin. After some headscratching, it seems to be consistent with a hollow space collapsing. You might want to watch your step here.

		LysoLanded = Lyso seems to be weakly geologically active, and has a convective asthenosphere and there are even detections of weak eruptions. These are likely very weak relative to what Lyso likely experienced in the past.

		CytoselLanded = Only the faintest of quakes can be detected on this long-dead moon, without a doubt caused by Reticulum's gravity and not processes occurring on or within Cytosel.

		ReticulumLanded = It doesn't take very long for the first hits to come in on the seismometer, and they're strong. Reticulum is a very active world indeed.
		ReticulumLandedLand = You're able to get a good look at how seismic waves bounce around Reticulum's interior, showing a two-layered core, a two-layered mantle, and a thick crust.
		ReticulumSplashed = Sadly the complete inability to detect shear waves makes getting insights into Reticulum's internal structure quite difficult. However the near-constant quaking of this world remains obvious and some amount of compressional waves are detected at almost all times. Or are those just waves in the water?
		ReticulumSplashedCenterOceans = The seismometer has some trouble getting clear readings as waves crash against the craft, however there does seem to be signs of seismic waves coming from almost directly below.

		AsiteParLanded = Asite Par experiences quakes on occasion, and you manage to detect one which allows insights into the structure of Asite Par's interior. It seems Asite Par has got a pretty sizable core.

		Exular = The goo finds no love out in this remote asteroid system, and makes a frothy mess as it dies.
		Yroptos = The goo finds no love out in this remote asteroid system, and makes a frothy mess as it dies.

		Ribo = Kept in its pressurized container, the goo doesn't seem to know if you've landed or not. You're not sure you'd notice if you were in its shoes either, and recheck the craft's telemetry just to be sure.

		GolgiInSpace = The shielding of Reticulum's magnetosphere makes life a bit easier for the goo.
		GolgiLanded = The goo displays fascinating self-organizational properties as it responds to the gravity of Golgi's surface after landing.

		LysoInSpace = The goo has made itself a hardy shell, but seems to be struggling due to a lack of nutrition moreso than the unforgiving environment of space.
		LysoLanded = The goo begins to form a latticework of complex structures, a previously unseen behavior, but is then accidentally vented into space. Oops.

		CytoselInSpace = The goo seems to be healthier on the outskirts of the Reticulum System, less radiation belts to worry about.
		CytoselLanded = In terms of radiation Cytosel might be the most pleasant of the Reticuloid moons. You can't help but wonder if living on Cytosel is more feasible than on Reticulum.

		ReticulumInSpace = The magnetic field of Reticulum is helpful in increasing the goo's chances of survival, and you swear it seems thankful.
		ReticulumFlying = It's starting to get a bit hot for the goo, it's bubbling.
		ReticulumLanded = The goo boils in its container, in part because its capsule is trapping more heat than its keeping out. Crew vehicles sent to Reticulum should take note not to derive themselves from goo capsules.
		ReticulumSplashed = The goo is becoming stew.

		AsiteParInSpaceLow = The goo seems to be responding poorly to the radiation environment of low Asite Par orbit.
		AsiteParInSpaceHigh = The goo survives, not comfortably, until it is exposed to the vacuum of space, when it does get exposed it dies rather spectacularly, in a morbid sense of the word.
		AsiteParFlying = The goo starts to get warmer.
		AsiteParFlyinghHigh = The goo seems somewhat more comfortable in the low temperatures of the upper atmosphere, but the difference is not too large.
		AsiteParLanded = The goo enters a blooming state, and seems to extend many pseudopods in anticipation of rainfall.
		AsiteParSplashed = The goo responds very poorly in direct exposure to the scalding waters of Asite Par.

		Exular = The materials seem to have little response to the conditions here aside from their usual responses to the environment of space.
		Yroptos = The materials seem to have little response to the conditions here aside from their usual responses to the environment of space.

		Ribo = Some materials show responses consistent with increased radioactivity.  It's likely Ribo and by extension Golgi are within a radiation belt.
		Golgi = Some materials show responses consistent with increased radioactivity. It's likely Golgi and by extension Ribo are within a radiation belt.

		LysoInSpace = An aerogel sample seems to have to experienced a hit, looks like you've caught a sample of Lyso's exosphere, perhaps even its ionosphere.
		LysoLanded = There are some indications of increased radioactivity, it would seem Lyso is on the outer edge of a Reticuloid radiation belt.

		Cytosel = There is little indication of radioactivity above usual ambient measures.
		CytoselInSpaceLow = The materials do not seem to be affected by Cytosel's miniscule exosphere.
		CytoselLanded = The materials do not seem to be affected much by Cytosel's miniscule exosphere.

		ReticulumInSpace = Some of the metallic samples seem to respond to entry into Reticulum's magnetic field.
		ReticulumInSpaceLow = There is a fairly punishing amount of radiation being netted by Reticulum's magnetic field in this region. The observations continue fairly well until a piece of ring material manages to fly into the bay causing a considerable disruption to all samples, but on the bright side also giving you a sample of Reticulum's rings.
		ReticulumFlyingHigh = Many samples already seem to respond to the increased heat of Reticulum's atmosphere, all of the previously frozen samples melt, and some even sublimate.
		ReticulumFlyingLow = The samples begin to boil, and the suit fabric samples are having a rough time against the heat and pressure. Luckily there is no oxygen in Reticulum's atmosphere to start a flame.
		ReticulumLanded = A lot of materials used in day to day architecture simply do not hold up to the conditions here and degrade. Meanwhile some spacesuit fabrics seem to have trouble holding up against the conditions as well.
		ReticulumSplashed = The samples boil and dissolve in the waves of Reticulum, and what an incredible smell you've discovered!
