			description = A typical K7V Orange Dwarf, Sauwel appears to most as a blinding white ball of light, or perhaps an inverted ghost image on their retina after they look away. This has long lead many scholars to consider Sauwel as a sort of eldritch horror, not meant to be seen by Kerbal eyes lest they go mad. However, in more recent times, astrophysicists have carefully studied those inverted ghost images (left behind on silver-halide based films and plates, instead of retinas) and have determined that, as bright as it is, Sauwel is just a regular ol' star. So that's not nearly as interesting. :/ \n [Editor's note: we have had to hire a new science communicator as the old one didn't think stars were cool.] \n -Luna Gregoria AKA GregroxMun]
