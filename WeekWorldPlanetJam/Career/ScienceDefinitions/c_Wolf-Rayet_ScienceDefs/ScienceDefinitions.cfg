		Exular = To no one’s surprise, this small moon has no thermal emissions of its own, the only variance in temperature comes from how much light is reflected or blocked by Exular’s surface.
		Yroptos = The thermal environment of this double asteroid is entirely defined by Sauwel, and these little worlds don’t do anything to resist that fact.
		Ribo = If you kept the experiment running long enough, and with equipment sensitive enough, you could probably measure the strength of the energy being reflected by Reticulum's rings from here, otherwise Ribo's temperature is only distinct from the rest of space in this part of the Sauwel System when its blocking out the star's light.

		GolgiInSpace = There's no notable change in the temperature here, it's all vacuum.
		LysoInSpace = There is a slight uptick in temperature readings, it's barely perceptible. There seems to be a high-energy particle cloud of some sort around Lyso.
		CytoselInSpace = This old world shows no signs of thermal emissions nor a medium through which they can be seen, its patchwork of different colorations does however mean the amount of reflected energy is fairly variable.

		ReticulumInSpace = This region of the solar system seems a bit hot for liquid water bodies, and yet . . .
		ReticulumFlyingHigh = The temperature is beginning to pick up as Reticulum's massive atmosphere puts on the pressure, at 32 kilometers there's a spike before readings begin to fall again. Reticulum has a thermosphere!
		ReticulumFlyingLow = At this altitude, below 14.5 kilometers, the temperatures are beginning to rise again, and quickly.
		ReticulumSrfLanded = It would seem that Reticulum's surface is indeed cool enough to host water oceans, sitting at 80 celsius however, it is far too warm to host Kerbals.
		ReticulumSrfLandedPoles = These were originally suspected to be made of water ice, however it is clearly far too warm for that to be the case.
		ReticulumSrfSplashed = Reticulum's seas are over twice the heat of a standard hot tub, and a Kerbal would instantly receive scalding third degree burns if they attempted to swim in them. Calling Reticulum "habitable" is certainly a bit of a stretch.
		ReticulumSrfSplashedCenterOceans = These oceans are notably hotter than they should be otherwise, the surface of the water is steaming. There must be a heatsource deep below the water here.

		Body

			name = WWPJ/ct //AsitePar
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = This energy recieved by Asite Par in this region of the Sauwel System places it effectively within what would be conservatively called the habitable zone, that is to say, not very pleasant, and yet here we are.
				InSpaceLow = Asite Par hosts a fair amount of reflective cloud cover, the effect of the clouds bouncing energy onto the craft is noticeable, these clouds help to keep our world cool enough for liquid water to exist.
				FlyingHigh = You've past the peak temperature of Asite Par's thermosphere, giving us unprecedented readings of its thermal gradient as the craft ascends.
				FlyingLow = Asite Par is not as hot as it could've been all things considered, but that doesn't mean it's comfortable. We need to employ complex methods to keep ourselves cooled off and alive, even on this world we call home.
				SrfLanded = Asite Par's slow rotation is one of its best defenses against the heat of Sauwel, but in isolation it wouldn't accomplish much. Other mechanisms are at play here.
				SrfSrfSplashed = To say the water is steamy would be an understatement, swimming in it without protection would result in heavy burns very quickly, at least for lifeforms that aren't native to this world, like us.

		Exular = There is no detectable devation from the vacuum of space around Exular.
		Yroptos = The Yroptos Double System has no notable exosphere, the only particles living in space around it are occasional ions stripped from the surface of Yroptos by the lashing of Sauwel's winds.
		Ribo = Ribo has no notable exosphere. You wonder if moonlets in the rings might experience some amount of drag.

		Golgi = Golgi is a vacuum, both in orbit and on the ground.
		LysoInSpace = Nothing from out here.
		LysoInSpaceLow = Lyso has a thin exosphere, though its specific nature is unclear, one may find over very long timescales objects may fall from orbit here. However the uneven gravity of its lumpy surface would likely accomplish that much faster.
		LysoSrfLanded = The exosphere of Lyso is detectable, but only barely.
		CytoselInSpace = Any atmosphere that may exist here is not able to be detected from up here.
		CytoselSrfLanded = The exosphere makes itself known, quietly. It's very inconsequential to the operation of spacecraft.

		ReticulumInSpaceHigh = Reticulum's atmosphere certainly exists, but does not extend this far.
		ReticulumInSpaceLow = Reticulum's exosphere extends to this distance, and the rings will certainly be lost to drag on astronomically short timescales.
		Reticulum = Reticulum's surface pressure would be survivable to a Kerbal without a spacesuit, if only barely. Eventually that will change for the worse, much worse.
		ReticulumFlyingHigh = Reticulum's atmosphere strikes suddenly and without warning, though there's other places in the Sauwel System that have it much worse.
		ReticulumFlyingLow = The pressure continues to rise, there is concern regarding what conditions await on the surface.
		ReticulumSrfLandedPeaks = With altitude there is a notable drop in pressure, it's actually quite similar to the atmospheric pressure of Asite Par here, but it's still far higher than Kerbals are used to.
		ReticulumSrfSplashedCenterOceans = There's a detectable vapor pressure here as steam rises around the craft.

				FlyingHigh = Asite Par's atmosphere is quite extensive, you wonder if rockets are necessary to get this far up, or if an ascent could be made on alternative means.
				FlyingLow = The atmosphere's pressure is still fairly impressive up here, and climbing out of it would be a considerable challenge if not for Asite Par's low gravity.
				InSpaceHigh = For its size and location, Asite Par has managed to snag quite the envelope, in terms of surface pressure it is within the range friendly to Kerbals. Of course, that atmosphere cannot be detected all the way out here, and Asite Par has other ways of killing you.

		Exular = Exular's gravity makes Yroptos' look strong. Variations in Exular's gravity well point towards several hollow cavities within.
		Yroptos = Yroptos' gravity may be minimal, but it's just enough to keep Exular happily in orbit. Only just. There are some indications that Yroptos is partially differentiated, and features that almost resemble magma chambers lie just below the crust.
		Ribo = Within this keyhole of gravity, Ribo is stable trailing an average of 60 degrees behind Golgi in its orbit. You can't help but wonder if Golgi was inspired by its parent planet.
		RiboSrfLanded = Ribo seems to be a solid unit all the way through.

		GolgiInSpaceHigh = Golgi has fairly strong gravity, enough to have significant influence on the structure of the inner Reticulum System. However, in the future the scales may tip in Reticulum's favor.
		GolgiInSpaceLow = Golgi's crust seems to be fairly heterogenous, with many distinct units of material of various scales scattered from the surface to the upper extent of a continuous mantle.
		GolgiInSpaceLowNorthRegion = This wide area, which occupies most of Golgi's northern hemisphere shows signs of an uplift in the underlying mantle, and the crust here is consistent and homogenous in structure, a material discontinuity with its surroundings.
		GolgiInSpaceLowHighland = These strange lumps on Golgi's surface do not have nearly the mass suggested by their size. Within these mounds, one might find they are significantly empty space.
		GolgiSrfLandedHighland = The domeworks are just that, hollow domes, perhaps created by volcanic processes not seen elsewhere. One may want to watch their step, they're unlikely to be entirely stable.
		GolgiSrfLandedCraters = Below the ground there seem to be several underlying units that have been compressed and fused by the energy of the impact that made this basin. These units likely existed as structures of notable vertical relief and high porosity prior to this impact.
		GolgiSrfLanded = Thanks to the instrument's sensitivity, the gravity of Reticulum is notably measurable from here. In the future Golgi will likely crumble as it falls inwards, forming a new, far denser Reticuloid Ring System.

		LysoInSpace = This Reticuloid Moon is expected to slowly spiral out from Reticulum. However, these readings on the local gravity field make it seem probable that as Golgi spirals in, it may drag Lyso along with it, and once Golgi has been disrupted, it may be too late for Lyso.
		LysoInSpaceLow = Lyso is most spherical, but its dramatic relief makes measuring the precise structures within somewhat challenging. Compensating for that variation, Lyso shows indications of a solid core, and a mostly solidified mantle. The asthenosphere does show some indications of plasticity, but if it does exist, it is quite weak.
		LysoSrfLanded = Lyso is a very consistent object internally, and shows no signs of anomalous structures within.

		CytoselInSpace = Cytosel has a very significant gravity well for its size, thanks to its location on the edge of the Reticulum System. In the distant future it may enjoy some time as a planet of its own, orbiting Sauwel independently.
		CytoselInSpaceLow = Cytosel shows little signs of any fluid motion internally, and seems to be comprised of simplistic layers, a metal core, rocky mantle, and thin crust, with the only variation being the thickness of the latter.
		CytoselInSpaceLowLow = Cytosel's crust is thinner in these regions, and shows signs of porosity. Perhaps lava tubes from a once-volcanic past.
		CytoselSrfLanded = Recordings of the local gravity field point to few variations in the underlying crust.
		CytoselSrfLandedLow = Recordings of the local gravity field point to cavernous structures below.

		ReticulumInSpaceHigh = Reticulum makes itself known with its extensive gravity well, and seems to be using the space well.
		ReticulumInSpaceLow = The Reticuloid crust has several distinct layers, which seem to have been deposited layer-by-layer by volcanic activity. But where are the volcanoes?
		ReticulumInSpaceLowLand = The crust seems to be compressed into mountains and canyons, with the layers bunched up into features that run perpendicular to the coasts of the Nucleic Oceans.
		ReticulumInSpaceLowCenterOceans = Below these circular oceans, the crust is extremely thin compared to other regions of the planet, with the mantle intruding significantly.
		ReticulumInSpaceLowSeas = The crust seems to have buckled in response to the pressure expanding out from the vicinity of the Nucleic Oceans, this may put some pressure on the underlying mantle, and perhaps introduces water to Reticulum's asthenosphere.
		ReticulumInSpaceLowPoles = These readings are inconsistent with water ice, however there does seem to be many caves below the cap, and they're full of something.
		ReticulumSrfLanded = The units below the surface tell the tale of a violently geologically active world, where land is crunched, molded, and recycled at the will of dramatic volcanism.
		ReticulumSrfSplashed = The crust below the water seems to have fractured, but remains quite thick.
		ReticulumSrfSplashedCenterOceans = There seem to be several large intrusive zones below the water, these are consistent with... volcanic magma chambers.
		ReticulumSrfLandedPoles = There are caves potentially filled with natural greenhouse gasses below the surface. The geology is quite turbulent on Reticulum, so they're unlikely to stay in the ground much longer. This planet is going to get a whole lot worse.
		ReticulumFlying = Variations in the make up of the surface are recorded as the craft flies overhead.

				InSpaceHigh = Asite Par has a decently sized hillsphere, it's a shame it hasn't caught any moons.
				InSpaceLow = From this altitude various structures can be observed within Asite Par's interior, there is a large discontinuity in the mantle, where a long-lost subducted continent is slowly being reclaimed. The crust also shows a fair amount of variance in its thickness.
				FlyingOceans = The oceans are slightly denser than otherwise expected for water, suggesting they are quite briney, anyone with a tongue could've told you that, if they were willing to risk burning it.
				Flying = Taking measurements of how the density of the surface below varies from place to place will go a long way in the quest to understand Asite Par's geology.
				SrfLanded = There are very few caverns in Asite Par's crust, and this reading doesn't change that.

		ReticulumSrfSplashed = Reticulum's atmosphere is  68% nitrogen, 31% carbon dioxide, and a full percent argon.

				SrfLanded = Asite Par's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but it also has a lot of dust in it which makes determining the exact radios a bit difficult from the ground.
				SrfSplashed = Asite Par's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but there's a fair bit more water vapor here than there is elsewhere, this is as expected.
				SrfLandedPlont = The moss enjoys the carbon dioxide, and the oxygen it provides in return helps to make Asite Par livable. One wonders how stable that arrangement might be long term.

		ExularSrfLanded = There are no signs of any internal activity, not even from gravitational stresses, not that there would be much of that coming from Yroptos.
		YroptosSrfLanded = Yroptos is definitely geologically dead, which is a shame
		RiboSrfLanded = Ribo experiences some weak quakes, with Reticulum, Golgi, and Lyso nearby, that's not surprising.

		GolgiSrfLanded = Quakes are detected as Golgi is strained by Reticulum's gravity.
		GolgiSrfLandedNorthRegion = Seismic activity is detected as the convective cells that make up this region slowly churn. It's unclear if this action represents the last remaining activity of a once hyperactive geologic past, or the beginning of a new era of activity as the tidal stresses from Reticulum increase.
		GolgiSrfLandedHighland = The instrument detects an event of unclear origin. After some headscratching, it seems to be consistent with a hollow space collapsing. You might want to watch your step here.

		LysoSrfLanded = Lyso seems to be geologically active, and has a convective asthenosphere and there are even detections of eruptions. These are likely weak relative to what Lyso experienced in the past.

		CytoselSrfLanded = Only the faintest of quakes can be detected on this long-dead moon, without a doubt caused by Reticulum's gravity and not processes occurring on or within Cytosel.

		ReticulumSrfLanded = It doesn't take very long for the first hits to come in on the seismometer, and they're strong. Reticulum is a very active world indeed.
		ReticulumSrfLandedLand = You're able to get a good look at how seismic waves bounce around Reticulum's interior, showing a two-layered core, a two-layered mantle, and a thick crust.
		ReticulumSrfSplashed = Sadly the complete inability to detect shear waves makes getting insights into Reticulum's internal structure quite difficult. However the near-constant quaking of this world remains obvious and some amount of compressional waves are detected at almost all times. Or are those just waves in the water?
		ReticulumSrfSplashedCenterOceans = The seismometer has some trouble getting clear readings as waves crash against the craft, however there does seem to be signs of seismic waves coming from almost directly below.

		Yroptos = The goo finds no love out in this remote asteroid system, and makes a frothy mess as it dies.

		Ribo = Kept in its pressurized container, the goo doesn't seem to know if you've landed or not. You're not sure you'd notice if you were in its shoes either, and recheck the craft's telemetry just to be sure.

		GolgiInSpace = The shielding of Reticulum's magnetosphere makes life a bit easier for the goo.
		GolgiSrfLanded = The goo displays fascinating self-organizational properties as it responds to the gravity of Golgi's surface after landing.

		LysoInSpace = The goo has made itself a hardy shell, but seems to be struggling due to a lack of nutrition moreso than the unforgiving environment of space.
		LysoSrfLanded = The goo begins to form a latticework of complex structures, a previously unseen behavior, but is then accidentally vented into space. Oops.

		CytoselInSpace = The goo seems to be healthier on the outskirts of the Reticulum System, less radiation belts to worry about.
		CytoselSrfLanded = In terms of radiation Cytosel might be the most pleasant of the Reticuloid moons. You can't help but wonder if living on Cytosel is more feasible than on Reticulum.

		ReticulumInSpace = The magnetic field of Reticulum is helpful in increasing the goo's chances of survival, and you swear it seems thankful.
		ReticulumFlying = It's starting to get a bit hot for the goo, it's bubbling.
		ReticulumSrfLanded = The goo boils in its container, in part because its capsule is trapping more heat than its keeping out. Crew vehicles sent to Reticulum should take note not to derive themselves from goo capsules.

				Flying = The goo starts to get warmer.
				FlyinghHigh = The goo seems somewhat more comfortable in the low temperatures of the upper atmosphere, but the difference is not too large.
				SrfLanded = The goo enters a blooming state, and seems to extend many pseudopods in anticipation of rainfall.

		Golgi = Some materials show responses consistent with increased radioactivity. It's likely Golgi and by extension Ribo are within a radiation belt.

		LysoInSpace = An aerogel sample seems to have to experienced a hit, looks like you've caught a sample of Lyso's exosphere, perhaps even its ionosphere.
		LysoSrfLanded = There are indications of increased radioactivity, it would seem Lyso is on the outer edge of a Reticuloid radiation belt, or that charged particles emitted by Lyso are trapped here.

		Cytosel = There is little indication of radioactivity above usual ambient measures.
		CytoselInSpaceLow = The materials do not seem to be affected by Cytosel's miniscule exosphere.
		CytoselSrfLanded = The materials do not seem to be affected much by Cytosel's miniscule exosphere.

		ReticulumInSpace = Some of the metallic samples seem to respond to entry into Reticulum's magnetic field.
		ReticulumInSpaceLow = There is a fairly punishing amount of radiation being netted by Reticulum's magnetic field in this region. The observations continue fairly well until a piece of ring material manages to fly into the bay causing a considerable disruption to all samples, but on the bright side also giving you a sample of Reticulum's rings.
		ReticulumFlyingHigh = Many samples already seem to respond to the increased heat of Reticulum's atmosphere, all of the previously frozen samples melt, and some even sublimate.
		ReticulumFlyingLow = The samples begin to boil, and the suit fabric samples are having a rough time against the heat and pressure. Luckily there is no oxygen in Reticulum's atmosphere to start a flame.
		ReticulumSrfLanded = A lot of materials used in day to day architecture simply do not hold up to the conditions here and degrade. Meanwhile some spacesuit fabrics seem to have trouble holding up against the conditions as well.

				SrfLandedDryLand = The samples not only get dirtied by the dust easily carried in the breeze, but the fine grains actually cause notable damage to some of the cloths and fabrics. They even degrade the door mechanisms of the bay somewhat.
				SrfSplashed = A great many of the samples boil, melt and dissolve into the waves of Asite Par. Some of the metallic samples rust over in reaction with the water, and many of the foliage samples turn sickly brown colors and shrivel in response to dissolved salts. Notably those salts were already in the water, and not put into it by your experiment.
				Flying = This environment is great for studying the effects of varying levels of oxygen exposure to various material components, however most of the materials came from Asite Par and thus have experienced oxygen exposure their whole life.
				InSpace = Metallic samples that were vacuum sealed during ascent seem to display an interesting property of fusing into a single unit without the need of hot welding. This could have applications in the future.

		YroptosInSpace = No intrinsic magnetic field is detected, but observing how Sauwel's magnetic field is subtly distorted by Yroptos can help determine the this little world's interal structure and differentiate between metallic and silicate deposits within its bulk. There are notably more metallic deposits the deeper into Yroptos you go, but the concentration change isn't dramatic enough between the surface and center to call this asteroid differentiated.
		YroptosSrfLanded = No local magnetic fields are detected in this area.
		YroptosSrfLandedCrater = Some very weak local magnetic fields are detectable here, likely metallic substances here were magnetized in the impact that formed this crater.

		Exular = Exular has no intrinsic field, and its impact on Sauwel's field in the immediate area is either nonexistant or too faint to detect.

		Ribo = Suddenly a bolt of charged particles erupts from Ribo's surface, giving the craft a shock of a few dozen volts! It seems that Ribo's surface is electrostatically charged by its interactions with Reticulum's magnetic field. How curious!

		GolgiInSpace = While difficult to determine by other means, Golgi's influence on the magnetic field suggests a partially molten mantle lies within this moon. Strangely Reticulum's magnetic field seems to be distorted by something outside of Golgi, particularly around its north pole. This may require a closer look.
		GolgiInSpaceLow = There are indications of local magnetic fields from this altitude, they're likely to be electrostatically charged regions, caused by impacts or Asite Par's interactions with Reticulum's field.
		GolgiInSpaceLowNorthRegion = There seems to be a weak intrinsic magnetic field, or perhaps multiple smaller fields, being generated by convective actions in the upper mantle below this region! This is a fascinating discovery, and is a method of field generation not seen elsewhere. It's unclear whether this makes crewed exploration of this region easier or not.

		LysoInSpace = Charged particles being emitted by Lyso have a considerable impact on Reticulum's magnetic field, and are being funneled by it and carried towards Reticulum's poles. This may have a noticable "footprint" in the Reticuloid auroras.
		LysoInSpaceLow = There is a torus of plasma around Reticulum generated by Lyso, it's very local, but if the volcanism experienced by Lyso now is enough to generate this, one shudders to think what a hazard it may have been at its height of volcanic activity.

		CytoselInSpace = Cytosel lacks any internal features large enough in their scale to alter the shape of Reticulum's magnetic field save for one; a solid metallic core.

		ReticulumInSpaceHigh = Reticulum's magnetic field is extensive and strong, even for a planet of its size. This is likely a blessing and a curse for the prospects of crewed missions here.

		LysoSrfLandedLowland = And you may ask yourself, "How'd Lyso work this?" And you may ask yourself, "What is this large space-vehicle?"

		CytoselInSpace = The light that shines through the window has a sickly green tinge. What an alien world you've stumbled on.
		CytoselSrfLanded = Your craft kicks up a considerable amount of dust, you take a moment to watch it slowly flutter to the ground in silent awe.
		
		RiboInSpace = Looking at Ribo from the window, you're astonished both by how large it is, and how large it isn't.
		RiboSrfLanded = You've landed? It doesn't feel like you've landed. You go to the window and check- what'd'ya know! You've landed! You have landed on Ribo. You feel like you won't get much enrichment out of the gravity here.
		
		YroptosInSpace = The asteroids before you host tremendous scientific interest, from their nature as a double system, to their place as the largest system on the opposite side of Reticulum.
		YroptosSrfLanded = Nice landing, if every operation here goes as smoothly as that you'll complete this mission with flying colors.
	
		ExularInSpace = It's the tiny lil one. The lil itty bitty one. The teeny weeny itsi bitsi little widdle smiddle tiny lil- you find yourself cut short by mission control asking you kindly to stop. Perhaps you should save it for the cold mic.
		ExularSrfLanded = You're worried if you sneeze too hard the craft won't be on the surface. Luckily one thing you can practically guarantee is that no allergens exist on Exular... unless you count dust. There's probably a fair bit of that. Good luck.

	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = WWPJ/ct //AsitePar
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = You collect a sample of the water in a specialized jar. The sample is briny and home to many marine planktons, most are purple, but the minority of species do indeed utilize once-familiar green chlorophyll.
				SrfLandedBullshit = The sample is grainy, but not cold to the touch. It doesn't seem to pack together well either. If local temperatures weren't a giveaway, it's certainly apparent now that years of briny rainfall over the poles has left a considerable deposit of not ice, but salt on the Parian north pole.
				SrfLandedWetLand = This region has a high groundwater concentration, and is as the name suggests very muddy. Reaching to collect a sample sends a few small animals scattering as your hand disturbs their homes in the mire. You barely get a good glimpse at them before they resubmerge. The Mudlands provide a home for a great many species, both flora and fauna, as well as a reliable source of water.
				SrfLandedDryLand =  Most rocks on the surface are coated in dust, and the few that stick out from the blankets of sand have been rounded by the wind's erosion. There is a great variety of rocks in this region, most are conglomerations of various igneous and sedimentary units. As you collect samples you find the discarded pupa of a hibernating insect, it's not immediately clear if its host hibernated through the day or night seasons, but it's a good find. Pupas like this are usually quickly consumed, even this one shows some indications of having been nibbled on. They are one of the only consistent food sources in these sprawling, arid deserts, and life here has evolved to take full advantage.
				SrfLandedPlont = You remove a chunk of purple moss from the ground. Retinal is the most popular chemical of choice for photosynthesis in the Parian Biosphere, and it's a far departure from the long gone greens of ancestral Kerbin. You notice many small bugs crawling and burrowing through the thick swatch you've removed. Knowing the history of parasitism between some species of moss and Kerbals, seeing this feels strange.
				
				
			}
		}
		
		
		ReticulumSrfLandedLand = The ground here is made of compacted and dense volcanic material. Removing a sample requires a fair amount of effort. This sample confirms the picture other data had already drawn for Reticulum; this planet was not just volcanic in its past, but heavily volcanic today. One wonders where that volcanism occurs, and more importantly, when.
		ReticulumSrfLandedPeaks = There is some amount of moisture trapped in the gravelly surface here, not enough to support someone for a prolonged period, but certainly still a notable distinction from the rest of the otherwise dry land on Reticulum.
		ReticulumSrfLandedPoles = This isn't ice at all! It's pumice, the exact mechanism that made these polar concentrations of pumice aren't clear, it could relate to the structure of ancient currents from times where the oceans were much higher, or they're perhaps the results of regional volcanic activities, with these caps being their last remaining footprints.
		ReticulumSrfSplashedSeas = The water has a lot of dissolved sediments, but with the right equipment it could be made safe to drink. Perhaps the exploration of Reticulum can take on a more permanent form in the future.
		ReticulumSrfSplashedCenterOceans = There are heavy concentrations of glass and ash in this water. Best not to drink it, if the throat-melting temperatures weren't enough to convince you.

		CytoselSrfLandedLow = This region is caked with dust from the numerous impact events that scar Cytosel's surface. It seems to be electromagnetically charged, as it clings relentlessly to all your equipment and spacesuit. You're not just collecting samples; you're getting covered in them. You have a feeling scientists back home will appreciate that.
		CytoselSrfLandedHigh = In the distant past, these were the regions of Cytosel that experienced the most volcanism. The mystery of why these volcanic regions align with areas of higher vertical relief can now be answered, as it seems these highlands built themselves up layer by layer through pelean eruption events, the great many impacts that have occurred since Cytosel died have obscured morphologies expected of volcanoes.
		CytoselSrfLandedNear = This crater seems to be one of the oldest on Cytosel's surface, based on the amount of dust obscuring its volcanic floor. Based on this data and crater counts it's estimated to have formed around 500-600 mya.
		CytoselSrfLandedFar = Vimentin Crater's floor has some small shards of impact glass among the usual regolith.

		LysoSrfLandedActive = There is a slight plasticity to the sample you collect. This might not be the safest spot for a crewed mission.
		LysoSrfLandedDEAD = You take a piece of basaltic rock and cache it for the trip home. Comparing this rock to others collected elsewhere on Lyso will allow the history to Lysan volcanism to be uncovered.
		LysoSrfLandedLowland = The volcanic materials here are mixed with impact powder, seperating the two may be better done in a lab back home. As much as can be afforded to carry is gathered, and you leave sorting it out to someone else.
		LysoSrfLandedHighland = Lyso's surface is covered with sulfuric compounds, emitted by its many volcanoes. However, since most of Lyso's volcanoes are no longer active, this sulfur is no longer being replenished faster than it is lost due to sublimation. Lyso will likely be far less yellow in the future.

		RiboSrfLandedGeneric = Ribo is rocky, and there don't seem to be any signs of volatiles on its surface. Deeper within there still might be some volatile compounds suitable for ISRU, Ribo might be a necessary component of long term operations in the Reticulum System.
		RiboSrfLandedCraters = Analysis of the isotopic ratios of the impact dust in this crater bowl confirms the impactor originated from beyond the Reticulum System.
		RiboSrfLandedKrags = Among the usual material, a strange lavenderish rock stands out from the rest. It's clearly not from around here, and further analysis confirms this is a meteroite that fell from Golgi.

		GolgiSrfLanded = Golgi's surface seems to be made mainly of basaltic materials. It would seem all the moons of Reticulum have or had their own spin on volcanism at some point in their pasts, perhaps even presents.
		GolgiSrfLandedHighland = Removing a sample is made difficult by the apparently flakiness of the material here, when you finally do remove a sample you're astonished at how lightweight it is. Looking down, you realize you've uncovered a hole into a large hollow chamber below you. You're suddenly quite nervous about standing here.
		GolgiSrfLandedNorthRegion = The rocks here are freshly formed, and were brought to the surface by the convective cells that make up this region. Golgi may not be strongly active geologically, but it is active nonetheless.
		GolgiSrfLandedCrater = The crater is covered in dust and rubble, the ground has been compressed and heated into a denser layer of material than is otherwise found on Golgi.

		YroptosSrfLandedHigh = There is a fair amount of metallic substances here, mostly iron, and it can be found in large flat units below the boulders of lighter rock. Perhaps Yroptos once experienced ferrovolcanism.
		YroptosSrfLandedCrater = You collect what remains of the other asteroids Yroptos snuffed out to maintain its rightful place as the king of the leading Reticuloid lagrange point. Or at least you hope you did, it's hard to tell at a glance, but the remains of the impactor would be a wonderful sample to gain an understanding of the evolution of the leading coorbital cloud.
		YroptosSrfLandedLow = Boulders and pebbles are scattered about this region, and it makes collecting a sample rather easy. So easy you have to make sure not to get carried away with gathering them.

		ExularSrfLanded = You got a rock! Exular has plenty of them. This rock tells a story, the story of an asteroid of decent scale who managed to form a smaller companion from the same cloud of debris. How heart-warming!
		ExularSrfLanded = You got a rock! This rock has a truly intriguing story to tell. Not only was Exular formed alongside Yroptos in the same cloud of material, but a third tinier companion too. Where has this companion ended up? Right below your feet! Exular seems to be a contact-binary!

		Body
		{
			name = WWPJ/ct //AsitePar
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The heat is getting to you pretty quickly, if not for this climate controlled spacesuit you'd already be in severe health, but it's still not comfortable.
				SrfLandedBullshit = The salt crunches below your boots, the bright deposits stretch as far as your eye can see, and is a great departure from the usual browns or saturated reds and purples you're used to. You take a moment to reflect on just how much of a divergence the view must be on other worlds, if this range can be achieved on just one.
				SrfLandedWetLand = You take a moment to survey your surroundings, and catch a few glimpses of the smooth-bodied finned creatures that dwell in this region. They surface and skitter across the mud in search of food before quickly returning to their homes below the ground, even for these native forms the surface of Asite Par is too warm for them to stay above ground for long. They're actually kind of cute, but the idea that they may be swimming through the mud below your feet without you knowing is decidedly less cute.
				SrfLandedDryLand =  Through the thick haze of dust, you swear you see a group of figures moving at the limits of your vision. Even in these harsher regions there is a great variety of life, so it's to be expected. It remains somewhat eerie though, and you suddenly find yourself hoping the recovery team comes faster.
				SrfLandedPlont = Thick blankets of moss cover all the rocks in this region, taking up all surface area available to gather as much of Sauwel's energy as they can. Opinions on the moss field are as diverse as individual Kerbals, some find the wide purple sprawls with the occasional blooming stalks very beautiful, others find them disturbingly alien.
				FlyingLowOceans = You look down at the water below and feel eerie knowing their heat makes the oceans the least understood region of Asite Par. You really don't want to be the one to make groundbreaking discoveries on the hemispherical ocean's food chain.
				FlyingLow = The atmosphere provides some noticeable resistance against you as you soar through the air, you really feel like returning inside.
				FlyingHigh = Diving from up here might be fun, or could be quite horrifying. Either way, there's certainly insights to be had about the nature of both the upper extents of Asite Par's atmosphere, and also Kerbal psychology.
				InSpaceLow = Stepping out into space is a strange experience in many respects. For one weightlessness can be dizzying enough on its own, but combined with the nauseating extent of empty space it becomes almost overwhelming. Depending on who you are this is fascinating, inspiring, or existentially horrifying. Not to mention that aside from Asite Par and your craft, it's a long ways to go to reach any surfaces where one can take literal steps.
				InSpaceHigh = The distant globe of Asite Par is strikingly beautiful, the blue oceans and purple moss carpets rubbing up against the brown mud and red sands, all just barely visible through the dust and windows in the clouds. You can't imagine a better world to call home, even if Asite Par is nothing like the ancestral home of Kerbalkind.
			}

		ReticulumInSpaceHigh = Gazing around you is a wonderful feeling. It's like you're flying along side the moons and parent planet as they orbit Sauwel. Suddenly it hits you, it's not *like* you're doing that, you *are* doing that. It's a warm feeling.
		ReticulumInSpaceLow = This region of the system has a higher than average micrometeorite risk, you're not sure if you want to stay outside for long. There's a small "tap" against your visor. No crack, but you're starting to pick up the pace of the EVA operation.
		ReticulumSrfLanded = Walking among the dramatic mountains sides and valley floors of this world is a surreal experience, far removed from the dusty plains of home. Not to mention the sky is full with items of interest, the moons and rings watch you work from above.
		ReticulumSrfLandedPeaks = This might be one of the best views the Reticulum System has to offer.
		ReticulumSrfLandedPoles = As you look out over the distant horizon, you take note that all of the intrigue held by the Reticulum System visually, its moons and rings, aren't visible at all here. It's a strange feeling.
		ReticulumSrfSplashed = High gravity, high atmospheric pressure, and scaulding hot water makes this a rather uncomfortable experience, as swimming requires great effort... maybe you should bring a boat, or at least a pool tube next time.

		RiboInSpace = You feel like you could reach out and touch Ribo, and while the distance your arms would have to cross makes that impossible, the fuel in an RCS pack alone would be enough to close the gap.
		RiboSrfLanded = You have to watch your step, you fear on this tiny world you might be able to trip and fall upwards.

		GolgiInSpace = The surface below is jagged and chaotic in some places, and comparatively smooth in others. It reminds you of something, but you can't put your finger on it.
		GolgiSrfLanded = You take note that Golgi doesn't have as much dust as you anticipated. The surface is pretty solid.
		GolgiSrfLandedHighland = Your boots seem to cause some flaking on the surface, small and thin sheet-like units of material are broken off the otherwise smooth ground by your footfalls. Interesting.
		GolgiSrfLandedCrater = You find yourself wondering if these craters were failed attempts at coorbital companions, and if perhaps someday Ribo will make its own scar on Golgi's surface. You then consider that Reticulum and Asite Par have the same relationship as Golgi and Ribo, and find your stomach ties itself into a knot. Best not to dwell on that.

		CytoselInSpace = You almost feel like you're intruding on Cytosel, who finds itself the center of its own little kingdom of gravity on the coastline of the Reticulum System, a few steps away from the interplanetary ocean. Cytosel doesn't seem to mind your visit however.
		CytoselSrfLandedNear = You try to lean back to get a look at Reticulum hanging above, but this suit makes that difficult. You decide you're okay looking at the rugged rim of the crater bowl.
		CytoselSrfLandedLow = Cytosel's surface is very dusty, and you find that bright equipment can be difficult to find after you set it down.
		CytoselSrfLandedHigh = The dark ground makes it very easy to identify pieces of equipment, but also brings out the stains of dark dust quickly caking everything as you work.
		CytoselSrfLandedFar = As you walk across the surface of a new world, you begin to make quite a fuss about a small mound you see. You take several images of it, compare it to a volcano while emphasizing it isn't a volcano. Despite this mission control asks you to confirm it isn't a tiny volcano. How magnificent.

		YroptosInSpace = Hanging out with the 'roids is quite relaxing. You feel carefree as you slowly drift through space with them in the low gravity environment.
		YroptosSrfLanded = You touch down gently on the surface of the parent asteroid, its rubbly lumpy surface stretches as far as the eye can see... which come to think of it isn't actually that far.

		ExularInSpace = You might as well have already landed, the velocity is very low here in orbit. You're more accurately parked along side Exular rather than truly orbiting it. You take note of the strange... lump on its south pole, its as though something is jutting out.
		ExularSrfLanded = It might be possible to walk into orbit here, you're tempted to try it. Mission control urges you: do not try it.
